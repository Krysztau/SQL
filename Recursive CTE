-- this works for MS SQL Server

-- in a sample table we have an id (id) and a number, how many times we need it repeated (numrep)
-- recursive table is adding one with each iteration, plus there is condition, not to add one above numrep.
-- numrep can be different for each id

WITH tbl1 
(id, numrep)
AS
(
SELECT 'a', 4
UNION ALL
SELECT 'b',6
)
,

recurs
(id, item_no, numrep)
AS
(
SELECT id, 1, numrep

FROM tbl1

UNION ALL
SELECT id, item_no+1, numrep
FROM recurs
WHERE item_no+1 <=numrep
)
SELECT id, item_no, numrep FROM recurs

ORDER BY 1,2
